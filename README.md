# ImportTemplate
A simple button to import an After Effects template file.

To use, place the "importTemplate.jsx"ù into your After Effects scriptsù folder. You can also drag and drop 

it to your "ScriptUI Panels" folder if you wish to dock the script as a panel.

By default, the script will import the included .aet file only  if it's in the same folder. Otherwise, 

click the "..." button and choose your own template file. The script will remember this file and all you 

will have to do next time is click "Import Project Template" button.ù 

Feel free to integrate this script into your own toolbars and pipelines!
